0. Create an array of integers. Write a program that outputs
a message about whether a given number is included in the array or not.
Let the number to search for be set from the console (Scanner class).

1. Create an array of integers. Delete all occurrences of the specified
number from the array.
Let the number be set from the console (Scanner class). If there is no such number
, print messages about it.
The result should be a new array without the specified number.

2. Create and fill the array with random numbers and output
the maximum, minimum and average values.
To generate a random number, use the Math.random() method.
Let it be possible to create an array of arbitrary size.
Let the size of the array be entered from the console.

3. Create 2 arrays of 5 numbers.
Output the arrays to the console in two separate lines.
Calculate the arithmetic mean of the elements of each array and
tell us for which of the arrays this value turned out to be greater (or
tell us that their arithmetic averages are equal).
